# OOP : to map with real world scenarios we started using objects in code

# Class and Object 

# Class : it is a blueprint for creating objects .

'''e.g'''

    # creating class
class Student :
    name = "Muzamil"

    #creating object (instance)

s1 = Student
print(s1.name)


class Car :
    color ="Black"
    mode = "Manuall"

car1 = Car
print(car1.color)
print(car1.mode)
